# Understanding Axiom Systems through Entailment Cones and Proof Path Analysis

## Project Overview

This is an on going project that seeks to deepen our understanding of formal axiom systems by systematically enumerating simple axiom systems and analyzing their entailment cones. We aim to compute both non-accumulative and accumulative entailment cones through the processes of substitution and co-substitution from various initial conditions. By exploring the structure of proof paths and identifying cycles, we hope to uncover topological insights into the nature of theorem derivation—a central aspect of metamathematics and formal logic.

Through this analysis, the project explores not only the combinatorial properties of axiom systems but also their topological and geometric characteristics, applying concepts from homology and homotopy theory to better understand their proof structures.

## Objectives
- **Enumerate Axiom Systems**: Define and explore different axiom systems using a two-way system with arbitrary rules from A ↔ A to BBB ↔ BBB.
- **Compute Entailment Cones**: Utilize substitution and co-substitution to calculate entailment cones from various initial conditions.
- **Proof Path Analysis**: Use proof path graphs across multiple iterations to generate sample types, identifying cycles through cycle graphs.
- **Graph Union**: Identify all cycles connected to the base axiom to uncover the structure and typological features of the system.
- **Topology Analysis**: Apply methods from homology and homotopy theory to understand the topology of entailment cones.

## Methodology
1. **Axiom System Definition**: Start with basic axiom systems and define rules within a two-way system framework.
2. **Entailment Cone Calculation**: Compute entailment cones using substitution and co-substitution techniques.
3. **Proof Path Graphs**: Create proof path graphs to explore different iterations and identify cyclic structures.
4. **Cycle Graphs**: Define proofs using cycle graphs and utilize graph unions to map out all possible cycles.
5. **Homology and Homotopy Theory**: Apply these mathematical methods to analyze the topological features of entailment cones.

##Project Scope Expansion

In addition to the core objectives outlined, the project also explores:

-**Proof Path Enumeration**: By enumerating proof paths and analyzing the variations between them, we can better understand the logical flow and possible bottlenecks in theorem derivation.
-**Substitution and Co-substitution**: These operations will be used to generate different entailment cones, with particular attention to how substitutions from different initial conditions lead to varying proof topologies.
-**Typology of Axioms**: Understanding how different types of axioms interact and how their logical consequences differ depending on the initial configuration.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Deeper Understanding of Theorem Derivation**: By examining entailment cones and proof path cycles, we expect to uncover fundamental structures that define how theorems are derived within simple axiom systems. This understanding will contribute to the broader study of metamathematics and formal logic.
- **Topological Insights**: Through the application of homology and homotopy theory, we will gain insights into the topological properties of entailment cones, such as identifying critical loops or cycles that play a key role in theorem propagation.
- **Proof Typology**: A classification of proof paths, based on their topological features, that may point toward universal properties of axiom systems.

##Future Directions

- **Scaling Up to More Complex Systems**: The methods developed in this project can be scaled to more complex axiom systems, potentially yielding new insights into higher-order logical frameworks and their entailment structures.
- **Machine Learning Applications**: We aim to explore machine learning approaches to predict patterns in entailment cone formation and proof path cycles, using data from our generated graphs.
- **Application to Formal Logic Systems**: This framework could be applied to formal logic systems in computational theorem proving, allowing for more efficient exploration of large theorem spaces.
