# Proof-Path-Analysis
 Understanding Axiom Systems through Entailment Cones and Proof Path Analysis
 
Project Description

This project aims to deepen our understanding of simple axiom systems by enumerating possible axiom systems and computing their entailment cones (both non-accumulative and accumulative) using substitution and co-substitution from different initial conditions. Through this approach, we seek to illuminate the structure and process of theorem derivation, an essential aspect of metamathematics.

Objectives

Enumerate Axiom Systems: Define and explore different axiom systems using a two-way system with arbitrary rules from A ↔ A to BBB ↔ BBB.
Compute Entailment Cones: Utilize substitution and co-substitution to calculate entailment cones from various initial conditions.
Proof Path Analysis: Use proof path graphs across multiple iterations to generate sample types, identifying cycles through cycle graphs.
Graph Union: Identify all cycles connected to the base axiom to uncover the structure and typological features of the system.
Topology Analysis: Apply methods from homology and homotopy theory to understand the topology of entailment cones.

Methodology

Axiom System Definition: Start with basic axiom systems and define rules within a two-way system framework.
Entailment Cone Calculation: Compute entailment cones using substitution and co-substitution techniques.
Proof Path Graphs: Create proof path graphs to explore different iterations and identify cyclic structures.
Cycle Graphs: Define proofs using cycle graphs and utilize graph unions to map out all possible cycles.
Homology and Homotopy Theory: Apply these mathematical methods to analyze the topological features of entailment cones.
Expected Outcomes

A comprehensive understanding of the structure and processes involved in theorem derivation within simple axiom systems.
Insight into the topology of entailment cones through homology and homotopy theory.
Development of foundational principles for further mathematical research in metamathematics and formal logic.
