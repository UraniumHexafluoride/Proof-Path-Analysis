6. KEY FINDINGS
-------------
1. Structural Patterns:
   - Independent statements have higher betweenness centrality
   - Statements classified as "both" have largest neighborhood sizes
   - Provable statements have more system predecessors

2. Neighborhood Analysis:
   - Average neighborhood size by classification:
     * Both: 6.00
     * Independent: 4.01
     * Provable: 2.07
     * Unknown: 2.31

3. Relationship Patterns:
   - Independent statements form bridges between mathematical areas
   - Provable statements cluster around formal systems
   - Hybrid statements (both) serve as critical connectors
