# Scraping Issues Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the scraping issues you encountered and the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Wikipedia 404 Errors
**Problem**: Many theorem names in the configuration don't have dedicated Wikipedia pages.

**Examples**:
- "Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra" → Actually covered under "Rank–nullity theorem"
- "Classification of Finite Simple Groups" → Should be "Classification of finite simple groups" (lowercase)
- Some theorems simply don't exist as standalone Wikipedia articles

### 2. nLab URL Formatting Issues
**Problem**: nLab uses `+` for spaces in URLs, not `_` like Wikipedia.

**Examples**:
- `fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic` → Should be `fundamental+theorem+of+arithmetic`
- The scraper was using Wikipedia-style URL formatting for nLab

### 3. Inconsistent Error Handling
**Problem**: 404 errors were being treated as fatal errors instead of expected outcomes for missing pages.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Wikipedia Source (`mathlogic/data/sources/wikipedia_source.py`)

**Improvements**:
- **Multiple URL format attempts**: Tries underscores, spaces, hyphens, case variations
- **Redirect mapping**: Built-in knowledge of common theorem name redirects
- **Wikipedia search integration**: Falls back to Wikipedia's search API when direct URLs fail
- **Better error handling**: Distinguishes between missing pages and actual errors

**New Features**:
```python
def _get_wikipedia_redirect(self, theorem_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
    # Maps common theorem names to their actual Wikipedia page names
    
def _search_wikipedia(self, theorem_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
    # Uses Wikipedia's search API to find the best match
```

### 2. Enhanced nLab Source (`mathlogic/data/sources/nlab_source.py`)

**Improvements**:
- **Correct URL formatting**: Uses `+` for spaces instead of `_`
- **Multiple format attempts**: Tries various combinations of case and separators
- **Better endpoint handling**: Tries `/show/`, `/page/`, and `/entry/` endpoints

**Key Changes**:
```python
# OLD: theorem_name = theorem.lower().replace(' ', '_')
# NEW: theorem_name = theorem.lower().replace(' ', '+')
```

### 3. Improved Base Source (`mathlogic/data/sources/base_source.py`)

**Improvements**:
- **Better 404 handling**: Doesn't treat 404s as fatal errors
- **Enhanced retry logic**: More intelligent retry strategies
- **Improved logging**: Better error messages and debugging information

### 4. Updated Configuration (`scraping_config.json`)

**Changes**:
- **Fixed Wikipedia URLs**: Replaced problematic theorem names with correct ones
- **Fixed nLab URLs**: Updated to use correct naming conventions
- **Removed non-existent pages**: Eliminated theorems that don't exist on certain platforms

## New Tools Created

### 1. URL Validator (`mathlogic/utils/url_validator.py`)
**Purpose**: Validates URLs before scraping to identify problems early.

**Usage**:
```bash
python validate_urls.py
```

**Features**:
- Tests multiple URL formats for each theorem
- Generates detailed validation reports
- Saves results for analysis

### 2. Configuration Fixer (`fix_scraping_config.py`)
**Purpose**: Automatically fixes scraping configuration based on validation results.

**Usage**:
```bash
python fix_scraping_config.py
```

**Features**:
- Applies known fixes for common URL issues
- Creates backup of original configuration
- Reports all changes made

### 3. Improved Scraper (`run_improved_scraping.py`)
**Purpose**: Enhanced scraping script with better error handling and progress reporting.

**Usage**:
```bash
python run_improved_scraping.py
```

**Features**:
- Progress bars for each source
- Detailed error reporting
- Comprehensive result metadata
- Better UTF-8 handling

## Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Validate Current URLs
```bash
python validate_urls.py
```
This will check all URLs in your configuration and identify problems.

### Step 2: Fix Configuration
```bash
python fix_scraping_config.py
```
This will automatically fix known issues in your configuration.

### Step 3: Run Improved Scraper
```bash
python run_improved_scraping.py
```
This will run the scraping with enhanced error handling.

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, you should see:

1. **Significantly fewer 404 errors**: Most common URL issues are resolved
2. **Better error messages**: Clear indication of what's missing vs. what's broken
3. **Higher success rates**: More theorems successfully scraped
4. **Detailed reporting**: Comprehensive logs and statistics

## Remaining 404s

Some 404 errors are expected and normal:

1. **Theorems that don't exist**: Some mathematical concepts simply don't have dedicated pages on certain platforms
2. **Different naming conventions**: Some sources use different terminology
3. **Incomplete coverage**: Not all mathematical knowledge is covered by all sources

## Configuration Recommendations

### Wikipedia Items to Keep:
- Well-established theorems with dedicated pages
- Famous conjectures and problems
- Classical results in mathematics

### Wikipedia Items to Remove/Replace:
- Obscure or very specialized theorems
- Theorems better covered under different names
- Non-existent pages

### nLab Considerations:
- nLab focuses on category theory and higher mathematics
- Many elementary theorems may not be covered
- Specialized in modern mathematical foundations

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Validation
Run URL validation periodically to catch new issues:
```bash
python validate_urls.py
```

### Log Analysis
Check scraping logs for patterns in failures:
```bash
tail -f entailment_output/scraped_data/scraping_*.log
```

### Configuration Updates
Update the configuration as you discover new theorem names or sources:
1. Add new theorems to appropriate sections
2. Remove consistently failing items
3. Update redirect mappings as needed

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Dynamic redirect detection**: Automatically discover Wikipedia redirects
2. **Fuzzy matching**: Use similarity algorithms to find close matches
3. **Cross-source validation**: Use successful finds in one source to validate others
4. **Machine learning**: Train models to predict correct URLs
5. **Community contributions**: Allow users to submit URL corrections

### Additional Sources:
1. **MathWorld**: Wolfram's mathematical encyclopedia
2. **PlanetMath**: Community-driven mathematics encyclopedia
3. **arXiv**: Mathematical preprints and papers
4. **Mathematical databases**: Specialized theorem databases

This comprehensive fix should resolve the majority of your scraping issues and provide a robust foundation for continued data collection.
