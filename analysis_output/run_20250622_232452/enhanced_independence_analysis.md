# Enhanced Independence Analysis

This report provides extended interpretations of the structural analysis.

## Interpretation of Centrality Metrics

Centrality metrics reveal the structural importance of theorems in the mathematical landscape:

### Degree Centrality

Degree Centrality measures the importance of a theorem in the network.

- **related_unknown** theorems have the highest average degree centrality (0.2263), suggesting they are structurally significant.

### Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness Centrality measures the importance of a theorem in the network.

- **provable** theorems have the highest average betweenness centrality (0.0027), suggesting they are structurally significant.

### Closeness Centrality

Closeness Centrality measures the importance of a theorem in the network.

- **related_unknown** theorems have the highest average closeness centrality (0.1145), suggesting they are structurally significant.

### Pagerank

Pagerank measures the importance of a theorem in the network.

- **related_unknown** theorems have the highest average pagerank (0.0056), suggesting they are structurally significant.

## Interpretation of Neighborhood Structure

The neighborhood structure reveals how theorems relate to their immediate surroundings:

### Formal System Dependencies

- **provable** theorems are proven by more formal systems (1.50 on average), suggesting they are more fundamental.
