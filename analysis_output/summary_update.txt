Just completed a major overhaul and new scraping run for my mathematical logic project, this time focusing on data quality and structural integrity over sheer size. This update marks a turning point: the transition from a noisy, overconnected graph to a smaller but much more reliable entailment network.

**Previous Approach (Old Run):**
- Integrated results from nLab, Wikiproofs, and Wikipedia with minimal filtering.
- Scraped: 100+ pages, 1,100+ relationships, 225 nodes, 351 edges.
- The graph looked impressive, but was riddled with noise: many relationships were generic, spurious, or not actually about theorems.
- Classification and centrality metrics were dominated by artifacts of the scraping process, not true mathematical structure.

**Key Issues Identified:**
- The scraper was pulling in links to categories, concepts, and non-theorem pages.
- The analysis pipeline was contaminated by legacy data files, reintroducing thousands of junk edges.
- As a result, the graph was large but misleading—most connections were not meaningful.

**Current Approach (Latest Run):**
- Completely reworked the pipeline to validate every relationship: only links to real theorems (by Wikipedia category) are accepted.
- Enabled category-based scraping, discovering 182 new theorems from major areas (number theory, geometry, algebra, etc.).
- Strictly excluded all legacy/contaminated data.

**Scraping Summary:**
- Successfully scraped: 187 theorems
- New relationships added: 59 (all high-confidence, validated)
- Failed pages: ~10 (mostly due to category naming mismatches)

**Graph Statistics:**
- Total nodes: 206 (198 theorems, 8 systems)
- Total edges: 60

**Classification Distribution:**
- Provable statements: 2
- Related provable: 6
- Related unknown: 198
- (No spurious 'both' or 'independent' classes—reflects the real structure of the data)

**Centrality Metrics (Averages):**
Classification   | Degree  | Betweenness | Closeness | PageRank
-----------------|---------|-------------|-----------|---------
Provable         | 0.2031  | 0.0358      | 0.1292    | 0.0742
Related provable | 0.0312  | 0.0000      | 0.1055    | 0.0298
Related unknown  | 0.0312  | 0.0022      | 0.0211    | 0.0269

**Top Theorems by Strength:**
1. Axiom of Choice (related_unknown): 6.2998
2. Fermat's Last Theorem (provable): 5.9908
3. Fundamental theorem of arithmetic (provable): 4.9181
4. Gödel's incompleteness theorems (related_unknown): 2.9959
5. Catalan conjecture (related_provable): 2.1876

**Notable Classical Results:**
- Zorn's Lemma: not present in this run (category mismatch)
- Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: 4.9181
- Fermat's Last Theorem: 5.9908
- Continuum Hypothesis: not present (category mismatch)
- P vs NP: not present (category mismatch)

**Structural Patterns Observed:**
- The graph is now much sparser, but every edge is meaningful.
- Provable statements have higher degree and PageRank, as expected.
- The "related_unknown" class is large, reflecting the many theorems for which no direct system relationship was found.

**Neighborhood Size by Classification (average):**
- Provable: 6.50
- Related provable: 1.00
- Related unknown: 0.29

**Critical Reflection:**
- The old graph was visually impressive but fundamentally misleading—most connections were noise.
- The new graph is smaller, but every node and edge is real and interpretable.
- The tradeoff: we now have a trustworthy foundation, but need to further expand our input (more categories, more sources) to recover the richness without sacrificing quality.

**The Road Ahead:**
1. Add more Wikipedia categories (fix naming mismatches, e.g., "Theorems in logic").
2. Integrate additional sources (nLab, ProofWiki) with the same strict validation.
3. Enhance relationship detection with more sophisticated NLP and cross-page reasoning.
4. Implement predictive modeling for independence likelihood.
5. Add interactive visualizations and expand axiom system analysis.

**Summary:**
This run marks a shift from "big but noisy" to "smaller but real." The next step is to scale up again—this time, with confidence that every connection in the graph is meaningful.

(Will post a more detailed update and code to GitHub later this week.)
