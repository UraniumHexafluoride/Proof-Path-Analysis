# Entailment Cone Research Plan

This document outlines specific research hypotheses and methodologies for the entailment cone analysis project.

## Research Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Structural Indicators of Independence
**Statement**: Statements that are independent from a formal system occupy distinctive structural positions in the entailment graph.

**Testable Predictions**:
- Independent statements will have higher betweenness centrality than provable statements
- Independent statements will form bridges between different clusters in the graph
- The neighborhood structure of independent statements will differ from provable statements

**Methodology**:
1. Compute centrality measures for all statements in the graph
2. Compare centrality distributions between known independent and provable statements
3. Analyze the local neighborhood structure of independent vs. provable statements

### Hypothesis 2: Minimal Axiom Systems
**Statement**: There exist natural groupings of theorems based on their minimal axiom requirements.

**Testable Predictions**:
- Theorems will cluster based on their minimal axiom requirements
- These clusters will correspond to recognized areas of mathematics
- Adding specific axioms will predictably affect which theorems become provable

**Methodology**:
1. For each theorem, identify the minimal set of axioms required for its proof
2. Cluster theorems based on similarity of their minimal axiom sets
3. Compare these clusters with traditional divisions in mathematics

### Hypothesis 3: Predictive Power of Entailment Structure
**Statement**: The structure of the entailment graph can predict the independence likelihood of open problems.

**Testable Predictions**:
- Structural metrics can predict independence with accuracy significantly above chance
- The prediction accuracy will improve as the graph becomes more comprehensive
- Certain structural patterns will be strongly associated with independence

**Methodology**:
1. Develop a predictive model using structural features of the entailment graph
2. Test the model on known independence results
3. Apply the model to open problems and evaluate its predictions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Validation (Current)
- Expand the entailment graph with more systems, theorems, and relations
- Validate independence predictions against known results
- Refine the prediction model based on validation results

### Phase 2: Structural Analysis (Next)
- Implement comprehensive structural metrics for the entailment graph
- Analyze the structural positions of independent statements
- Identify patterns in the minimal axiom requirements for theorems

### Phase 3: Predictive Modeling
- Develop a machine learning model to predict independence likelihood
- Train the model on known results and evaluate its performance
- Apply the model to open problems and generate predictions

### Phase 4: Visualization and Interpretation
- Create interactive visualizations of the entailment graph
- Highlight structural patterns associated with independence
- Interpret the results in the context of mathematical logic

## Expected Outcomes

1. A validated method for predicting independence likelihood
2. Insights into the structural organization of mathematical knowledge
3. A computational framework for analyzing logical relationships
4. Potential identification of new independence results
