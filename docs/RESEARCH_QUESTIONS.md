# Research Questions for Entailment Cone Analysis

This document outlines potential research questions that can be explored using the entailment cone framework.

## Structural Questions

1. **Critical Junctures**: What are the critical junctures (cut vertices) in the logical structure of mathematics, and what does their position tell us about the organization of mathematical knowledge?

2. **Natural Divisions**: Do the connected components and communities in the entailment graph correspond to recognized divisions in mathematics (e.g., algebra, analysis, topology)?

3. **Minimal Axiom Systems**: What are the minimal axiom systems required for various theorems, and are there patterns in these requirements?

## Independence Results

4. **Independence Patterns**: Are there structural patterns in known independence results that could help predict new independence results?

5. **Independence Likelihood**: Can we develop reliable metrics to predict the likelihood that a statement is independent from a formal system?

6. **Resolution Axioms**: What axioms are most effective at resolving independence results, and are there patterns in these resolutions?

## Logical Strength

7. **Strength Hierarchy**: Is there a natural hierarchy of logical strength among mathematical statements, and how does it relate to traditional hierarchies?

8. **Strength Metrics**: What metrics best capture the notion of logical strength, and how do they correlate with other properties?

9. **Strength Clusters**: Do mathematical statements naturally cluster based on logical strength, and what do these clusters tell us?

## Open Problems

10. **Open Problem Structure**: Do open problems have distinctive structural positions in the entailment graph?

11. **Resolution Predictions**: Can structural analysis predict which axioms are most likely to resolve open problems?

12. **Problem Difficulty**: Can we develop metrics for the difficulty of open problems based on their position in the entailment graph?

## Historical Development

13. **Knowledge Evolution**: How has the structure of mathematical knowledge evolved over time?

14. **Discovery Patterns**: Are there patterns in how new mathematical knowledge is discovered and integrated into the existing structure?

15. **Prediction of Discovery**: Can structural analysis predict which areas of mathematics are ripe for new discoveries?
