# Entailment Cone Analysis Report

## 1. Cut Vertices Analysis

Found 3 cut vertices in the entailment graph. These represent critical points
in the logical structure of mathematics, where removing them would disconnect parts of the graph.

Top cut vertices:
- ACA0
- Con(PA)
- ZFC

## 2. Connected Components Analysis

The entailment graph contains 1 connected components, suggesting
distinct areas of mathematical reasoning that are not directly connected.

Component details:
- Component 1: 14 nodes (9 systems, 5 theorems)

## 3. Minimal Axiom Systems Analysis

Found 7 distinct patterns of minimal axiom requirements.
This shows how theorems cluster based on their logical dependencies.

Most common minimal axiom systems:
- ZFC+LC: required for 9 theorems
- ZFC+PD: required for 8 theorems
- ZFC+MM: required for 8 theorems
- ZFC+AD: required for 8 theorems
- PA2: required for 7 theorems

## 4. Cycle Analysis

Identified 6 fundamental cycles in the entailment graph.
These represent alternative proof paths or circular dependencies in the logical structure.

Cycle statistics:
- Average cycle length: 3.33 nodes
- Longest cycle: 4 nodes
- Shortest cycle: 3 nodes

## 5. Research Implications

### Structural Bottlenecks
The cut vertices represent critical junctures in mathematical knowledge.
These might be good targets for further research or axiomatization.

### Logical Geography
The connected components suggest natural divisions in mathematical reasoning.
This may align with traditional divisions between different areas of mathematics.

### Proof Economy
The minimal axiom analysis reveals which formal systems are most economical
for proving certain theorems. This could guide mathematicians toward the most
efficient axiom systems for their work.

### Redundancy and Robustness
The fundamental cycles suggest redundancy in the axiom systems, providing
multiple proof paths and making mathematical knowledge robust against the
potential failure of individual axioms or proof techniques.
