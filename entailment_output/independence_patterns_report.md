# Independence Patterns Analysis

## Overview

This analysis compares 0 independent theorems with 0 provable theorems to identify structural patterns.

## Significant Indicators of Independence

No significant indicators were found. This may be due to insufficient data or lack of clear patterns.

## Interpretation


## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, we recommend:

1. Using these indicators to develop a predictive model for independence
2. Expanding the dataset with more theorems to strengthen the statistical significance
3. Investigating the causal relationships behind these correlations
