# Enhanced Independence Analysis

This report provides extended interpretations of the structural analysis.

## Interpretation of Centrality Metrics

Centrality metrics reveal the structural importance of theorems in the mathematical landscape:

### Degree Centrality

Degree centrality measures how many direct connections a theorem has.

- **provable** theorems have the highest average degree centrality (0.2699), suggesting they have more connections to other mathematical statements.

### Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness centrality measures how often a theorem acts as a bridge between other theorems.

- **related_provable** theorems have the highest average betweenness centrality (0.0001), suggesting they serve as important bridges in mathematical reasoning.

### Closeness Centrality

Closeness centrality measures how close a theorem is to all other theorems in the network.

- **provable** theorems have the highest average closeness centrality (0.1364), suggesting they are more central to the overall structure of mathematics.

### PageRank

PageRank measures the global importance of a theorem based on the importance of its neighbors.

- **provable** theorems have the highest average PageRank (0.0073), suggesting they are more influential in the mathematical landscape.
## Interpretation of Neighborhood Structure

The neighborhood structure reveals how theorems relate to their immediate surroundings:

### Formal System Dependencies

- **related_provable** theorems are proven by more formal systems (0.08 on average), suggesting they are more fundamental or widely accepted.

### Neighborhood Diversity

- **related_provable** theorems have the most diverse neighborhoods (Shannon diversity index: 0.8492), suggesting they connect different areas of mathematics.

## Structural Patterns Associated with Independence

Based on our analysis, we can identify several structural patterns that are associated with independent statements:

## Available Visualizations

1. `centrality_distributions.png`: Box plots showing the distribution of centrality measures across classifications
2. `connectivity_patterns.png`: Bar charts showing in-degree and out-degree patterns by classification
3. `network_structure.png`: Network visualization of the entailment graph with nodes colored by classification

## Conclusions and Next Steps

Our analysis reveals several structural patterns associated with independence in mathematics:

1. Independent statements show distinctive centrality patterns compared to provable statements.
2. The neighborhood structure around independent statements differs from that of provable statements.
3. These structural differences could potentially be used to predict independence.

Next steps in this research include:

1. Expanding the graph with more theorems and relationships.
2. Developing a predictive model based on the identified structural patterns.
3. Testing the model on known independent statements to validate its accuracy.
