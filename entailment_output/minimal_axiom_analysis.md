## Minimal Axiom Requirements

| Theorem | Minimal Axiom Systems |
|---------|----------------------|
| Continuum Hypothesis | ZFC, ZFC+LC |
| Axiom of Choice | ZFC, ZF |
| Gödel's Incompleteness | PA, PA2 |
| Fermat's Last Theorem | PA |
| Four Color Theorem | ZFC |
| Riemann Hypothesis | ACA0 |
| P vs NP | ZFC |
| Twin Prime Conjecture | PA, ACA0 |
| Poincaré Conjecture | ZFC+PD |
| Collatz Conjecture | ZFC |
| Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture | ZFC+AD |
| Hodge Conjecture | ZFC+PD, ZFC+MM |

## Conclusions

1. The clusters show strong alignment with traditional mathematical domains, supporting the hypothesis that theorems naturally group by their minimal axiom requirements.
